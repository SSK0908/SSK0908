#### I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student and my course is supposed to specialize in AI, but lets see how that goes. My first year wasn't so productive as it was online and we all know how well an 18 year old studies online with no one to constantly monitor them. Now I met my friend [SuperSecureHuman](https://github.com/SuperSecureHuman) who's achieved a lot at 19 and well he's the inspiration for this readme file. Hopefully, when I look back through my repositories after a few years, I'll be proud of my progress.

## - ðŸ¤” I currently know

#### Python, Matlab, Java, Javascript and C, and a very useless language, Jack very well. I can also entertain high school kids with my Scratch and Scribble skills. I'm also proficient with ML and DL libraries like Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines3 and other basic python libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I'm also know web development libraries and tools like React and TailwindCSS

## - ðŸŒ± I wish to learn

#### Pytorch, GOlang, Kotlin, NLP and RL

## - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

#### Anything. I'll be more than grateful to be approached to help with anything as long as it helps me to learn more.
