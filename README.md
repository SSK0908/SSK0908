I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student and my course is supposed to specialize in AI, but lets see how that goes. My first year wasn't so productive as it was online and we all know how well an 18 year old studies online with no one to constantly monitor them. Now I met my friend @SuperSecureHuman who's achieved a lot at 19 and well he's the inspiration for this readme file. Hopefully, when I look back through my repositories after a few years, I'll be proud of my progress.

#### - ðŸ¤” I currently know

Half-baked Python, Matlab, Java and C, and a very useless language, Jack very well. I can also entertain high school kids with my Scratch and Scribble skills

#### - ðŸŒ± I wish to learn

Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Javascript and also Android Development

#### - ðŸ˜„ I'm looking for help with

Pretty much everything tbh but hopefully in a few months I'll be capable of helping someone who will be in the same place as me right now

#### - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

Anything. I'll be more than grateful to be approached to help with anything as long as it helps me to learn more.
